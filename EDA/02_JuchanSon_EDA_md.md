## 2. Univariate analysis <br>
There are many variables in Dallas' crime data.<br> In order to execute EDA suitable for the purpose using this data, the analysis must be conducted using only the necessary variables. <br>Therefore, variables were classified according to The Six Ws(When, Where, Who, What, Why, How).<br>Some of the variables were not clearly distinguished among The Six Ws, but the report was prepared according to this criterion as much as possible.
