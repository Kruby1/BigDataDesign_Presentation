- Finding the Best Location for Pumping Stations in the Galovica Drainage Area of Serbia: the AHP Approach for Sustainable Development
    
    The study aimed to determine the optimal location for pumping stations in the Galovica drainage area of Serbia, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for sustainable development. AHP is a multi-criteria decision-making tool that considers both qualitative and quantitative factors.
    
    The researchers identified six criteria for determining the best location:  **land use, water quality, hydraulic capacity, energy efficiency, construction costs, and maintenance costs**.
    
- DROUGHT MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM
    
    The article presents the steps taken by Melbourne's water supply system to manage drought, including increasing storage capacity, reducing water demand through water conservation and efficiency measures, and implementing alternative water sources such as desalination and recycled water.
    
    - **water demand of the region**
    - **net revenue: water selling cost, electrical cost for pumping water**
    
- A case-based reasoning approach for estimating the costs of pump station projects
    
    The study proposes a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach for estimating the costs of pump station projects. The study found that the CBR approach was able to accurately estimate the costs of pump station projects, with an average error of 4.9%. 
    
    Some typical factors and components which may be included in a reliability and availability evaluation are as follows: 
    **(1) Water demand and emergency storage.
    (2) Preventative maintenance.
    (3) Wear/life expectancy of subcomponent.
    (4) Repair.
    (5) Power transmission.
    (6) Parallel operation and stand-by equipment.
    (7) Emergency power.
    (8) Surge protection.
    (9) Pumps, valves and piping
    (10) Motors.
    (11) Controls.
    (12) Time factors.**

    유역특성을 활용한 물수지 분석: 
    
    분석 자료를 통해 산출된 필요수량과 공급가능수량으로 물 부족량을 산출하였, 이를 토대로 초기 저수율별 임시대책 (관정개발, 양수기 설치)과 항구대책 (말단 물 부족지역 양수장 신설, 영산강-나주호 연계 양수저류)으로 나누어 비교하여 대안을 평가하였다.
